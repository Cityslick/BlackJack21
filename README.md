[BLACKJACK] Proposal

What is Blackjack?

Blackjack 21 is one of the most widely played casino games in the world.
It's primarily a comparison card game with players competing against the dealer with
the objective of winning by being the getting 21 points or reaching a higher score
than the dealer without going over 21 points.

Initial thoughts on game structure

I found some sprites of playing cards in .jpg format so my initial wariness
regarding doing my own card images was greatly reduced. The biggest part of the game now
would be the game logic within the card comparisons and also how that would affect the betting
as well. 

Phases of Completion

Step 1: Acquire all images, the deck of cards and betting chips.
Step 2: Format the HTML and then apply CSS to the Index.html file to make sure everything is sized and placed properly.
Step 3: CSS animations and the like in order to properly asses the right movement of the images/divs when certain actions are requested via a click of a particular button.
Step 4: Implement the logic that occurs within the game so the AI (dealer) responds appropriately to the user. 
Step 5: Test, test, and more testing. 
Step 6: Submit final version of the project. 

Links and Resources

I found the cards through a website called Opengameart.org and hopefully can find some sprites of
casino chips too.
