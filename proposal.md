BLACKJACK 21

What is BlackJack?

Blackjack 21 is one the most widely played casino games in the world.
It is primarily a card comparison game with the player going head to head with
the dealer. The first to 21 wins or the the higher score without going over 21 wins.
The reason I wanted to make this game is because I have wanted to make a card
game for a while now and also I feel the logic of this game would also be 
a good challenge and help to further my skill at coding in Javascript. 

Technical Discussion

I will be using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript for this project.
Maybe there might be some JQuery involved too as well. 

Notes on Game Structure

The game would involve a deck of 52 playing cards with each person (user and computer)
both recieving two cards. Then the user has the option to bet again, split the cards,
take a "hit" and add another card or to "stay" and let the dealer try to reach 21. The challenge
comes when trying to code all the various scenarios that would occur within the game
and also the various options the user could make with the cards they were dealt and the
(remaining) chips that they have.

a "live" dealer?
